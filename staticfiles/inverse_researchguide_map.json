      "Other reasons for unsuccessful searches may include: the estate was not liable to death duty the assets were valued at less than \u00a31,500 (in these cases taxes were often not collected and the register entry was often not filled in with all the details) alternative spellings of personal names and place names were used (English spelling had not yet been standardised in this period) Contact us for advice Still need help?",

      "For example: Prerogative Court of Canterbury wills (1384-1858) Inquisitions post mortem (1236-c1640), which give details of people who held land directly from the Crown records of Crown wardship of male heirs under 21 and female heirs under 14 (1540-1645) records of land conveyances (13th century onwards) and Crown, church and royalist lands (1642-1660) Privy Council records (1386 onwards) State Paper Office records (up to 1782) \u2013 many of these have been digitised and are available on the State Papers Online (\u00a3) website, and you can find calendars on the British History Online website Also consult the various types of parchment rolls from the Court of Chancery (13th century onwards), in particular: patent rolls in C 66, which contain grants of land and wardship fine rolls in C 60, which include grants of wardship and marriage charter rolls in C 53, which contain grants of property in the presence of witnesses close rolls in C 54, which include enrolments of private deeds and writs of livery and seisin conveyances of freehold estates by deeds of bargain and sale enrolled on the close rolls after 1535 Although the Chancery rolls are largely concerned with people who were of sufficient status to have direct dealings with central government, they do contain many references to other people as well.",

      "Also note from the map the (civil) parish in which the farm lay, as you will need this to order the individual farm record forms If you are viewing the map after viewing the individual farm records: You can find the farm using the farm code, to view the layout and detail of its fields, buildings and roads If your farm had any other lands which are shown on adjacent map sheets, this will normally be indicated by the appropriate Ordnance Survey map reference; on the other map(s), look for the same individual farm code.",
      "If you do not know the parish of your farm, or it is a very large parish, to obtain the individual farm number that it was given by the survey you will need to: Consult one of the survey maps (see section 5) for the parish and farm code (see section 3) Once you have the parish code, use the advanced search in our catalogue to search within MAF 32 by county and code."
